# Bellabeat Project
This project is apart of the Google Data Analytics Certification. In it I work as a data analyst for a company Called Bellabeat, which is a tech company that creates smart products designed for woman that track their health data. The goal of this project is to analyze smart device data, that is not related to Bellabeat, in order to get a better understanding of how consumers use these devices. 
# Bellabeat, the company

Leaf is a fashionble product that can be worn as a necklace, bracelet, or clip. This products create data that is then sent to the Bellabeat app. The Time product does the same thing as that of the Leaf, but is in the form of watch thay can be worn around the wrist.
