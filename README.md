# Bellabeat Project
This project is apart of the Google Data Analytics Certification. In it I work as a data analyst for a company Called Bellabeat, which is a tech company that creates smart products designed for woman that track their health data. The goal of this project is to analyze smart device data, that is not related to Bellabeat, in order to get a better understanding of how consumers use these devices. 
# Bellabeat, the company
Bellabeat is a high tech company that focuses on the overall health of woman by developing different smart products. The company has four different products: the Bellabeat app, Leaf, Time, and Spring. 

The Bellabeat app generates the users health data, which includes things such as sleep, steps, distance traveled, intake of calories, and intensity. Leaf is a fashionble product that can be worn as a necklace, bracelet, or clip. This products create data that is then sent to the Bellabeat app. The Time product does the same thing as that of the Leaf, but is in the form of watch thay can be worn around the wrist. Spring is a water bottle that tracks how much water someone drinks in a day.

Bellabeat also has a membership available for customers. This membership provides customized advice on sleep, daily activity, nutrition, and more.
